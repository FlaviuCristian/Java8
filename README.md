# Java8

Create a Person / Car custom object of choice with any number of fields (> 2) of different types.

1) Write 5 different instances of that object.

Add the instances to a list.

2) Find the elements containing the letter "a" that start with "M" and print them out.

Add the instances to a set.

3) Find the "min" using a custom comparing criteria of choice

4) Generate 5 random Strings and add them to a Set. Find the "max" (while explaining as Javadoc how comparing Strings works)

5) Generate a random number of Integers and then count them. "Map" the exponential to the numbers and then print them out.

6) Create a map of "n" (K,V) elements and print "how many" elements have value over 10 (the key is of your choice)

7) Sort the above Set<String> (used for max) in reverse order

8) Sort the above List of custom objects (used for filter) in an order you consider

9) Check if any of your instances "match" a condition based on an Integer field (of your choice). What does it return ? Print it out.

10) What does Optional represent ? Explain through an example on your custom object

-> Wrap an existing instance

-> Wrap a null

-> Check value using ifPresent or isPresent

11) Fastest way to find the shortest String in a List (take the 5 random Strings generated above and find the shortest one).
